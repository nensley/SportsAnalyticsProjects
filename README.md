Welcome! I'm a conscientous, data-driven storyteller, specializing on deriving new relevant metrics and visualizing information in a profound way. I graduated with an Applied Data Science Master's Degree from IU Indianapolis in December 2024, where I specialized in Sports Analytics. During that time, I worked with the Women's Basketball team, where I enhanced their data collection framework, derived new KPIs, and made data-focused lineup recommendations. Additionally, I developed dashboards and machine learning models to drive insight for Andretti Global and Sports Tech HQ in a consulting position.

This repository shows the projects I completed in my Advanced Sports Analytics class
* **colts_game_1:** I analyzed the Indianapolis Colts' first 2025 game against the Miami Dolphins. I provided a focused analysis for coaches that identified what run gap was most successful for the Colts and what receivers provided the most value
* **punting_metric:** I crafted a novel Punter Rating that combines parameters aimed at assessing precision punting and long punting performance based on field position.
* **hit-em-in-stride-final** I worked with a group to develop a disruption score to assess the quality of a quarterback's throw to a receiver. A lower disruption score indicated that the quarterback better hit a receiver in-stride, leading to a greater chance of getting explosive plays

**TECHNICAL SKILLS**
* **Languages**: Python, R, SAS
* **Databases**: SQL
* **Platforms**: Windows
* **Web Development**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP
* **Miscellaneous**: Tableau, Power BI, Microsoft Excel, Adobe Lightroom, Canva
